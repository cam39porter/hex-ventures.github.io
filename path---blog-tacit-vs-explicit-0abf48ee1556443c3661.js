It is a great read and I recommend it to anyone who has forty five minutes to invest in themself.</p>\n<p>The development of the Neocortex allowed humans to share what they had learned. When the Neocortex advanced to the point that humans could symbolically refer to a thing with a sound, it opened up a whole new world of possibilities.</p>\n<p>We could now tell someone about how to make a fire, fix a roof, or how to make a spear for fishing.</p>\n<p>Huzzah! Knowledge could now be shared, and with this breakthrough, each generations\' starting point of knowledge became where the last one left off.</p>\n<h3 id="the-brothers-knowledge"><a href="#the-brothers-knowledge" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>The Brothers Knowledge</h3>\n<p>So, our Neocortex gave us the ability to capture and share what we learn through language.

It is knowledge created by experiences, insights, intuitions, and observations. Being good at selling, for example, would be tacit knowledge. Acting with the proper etiquette at a traditional Chinese meal would also be tacit - you learn these things via experiences and your own natural intuitions.</p>\n<h3 id="capturing-the-little-things"><a href="#capturing-the-little-things" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Capturing the little things</h3>\n<p>We at Hex believe that while many tools have been developed to help capture explicit knowledge - Microsoft Office, Evernote, etc - the way we organize and share that explicit knowledge can still be made much more efficient.
