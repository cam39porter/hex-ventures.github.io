Will and George used the APL as their own launching pad to bring a an idea from side-project to technological breakthrough.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Connect, not protect: I have written previously about how companies can use Lisa Gansky’s concept of <a href=\\\"https://hex-ventures.github.io/hex-ventures/blog/connection-trumps-protection\\\">mesh</a> as a principle around which they organize. Creating a robust support network at a company is vital to positive idea generation and smart risk-taking.
