A pivotal step in making individuals and teams more effective and creative. </p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Keep your working memory “fresh.”</strong> Humans naturally forget things. Active reflection — re-reading old notes and ideas — will make more of what you know top-of-mind and useable.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Insert randomness into your workflows.</strong> Entropy can be the key to unlocking a new idea or the <em>aha!</em> moment when attempting to solve a problem, basic or complex.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>These ideals are embedded in Tangle’s user experience. To achieve them, we completely scrapped the traditional concept of organization. Putting information in files, folders, and digital notebooks is self-defeating; humans naturally aren’t very good at it, and we often have a difficult time predicting how we will eventually use the information that we save.</p>\\n<p>Instead of forcing organization on the user, Tangle creates automatic, visual connections between related information (e.g., meeting notes, an idea, or a to-do). These visual connections replace the need for manual organization. Tangle accomplishes this using something called entity extraction: the system identifies key-terms and searches for other information you have captured with those same or related terms. It then connects the information in real-time on the screen using a graphical interface. It becomes immediately clear why two things are connected. The experience of <em>“connecting the dots”</em> after capturing a bit of information helps strengthen the connections between what you know and refreshes your working memory. </p>\\n<p>Tangle also encourages you to make your own connections. You can make explicit connections between the information you capture using hashtags as well as a feature we call Brainstorm mode. <strong>More on that in posts to come...</strong></p>\\n<p>Tangle is currently in its infancy. Like us, it will become more intelligent as it gets older. Eventually, it will be able to connect the dots between your implicitly related information as well. For example, while they may not necessarily have a direct text-match, separate notes captured about two people may be recommended as a connection if those people share a commonality. You may capture one note broadly related to “technology” that mentions Joe, and you may have captured another note related to “technology” that mentions Jill. In the future, Tangle might recommend a connection between separate captures about Joe and Jill because the two are topically related. These “smart connections” will transform how you work.</p>\\n<p>Tangle doesn’t just surface connections when you capture new information, it also allows search. In traditional note-taking applications, a search will yield results that directly match the query. The issue here is that when we search for things, we often don’t know exactly what we are looking for, just directionally what we hope to find. So, rather than providing just traditional search results, Tangle surfaces a whole graph of visually contextualized connections including both direct and indirect matches. Just toggle to the search bar and enter a query like you would a search engine. Easy. To drive the point home, there is no responsibility on you to organize your information, Tangle does it automatically, and keeps all of your connected knowledge at the tip of your finger. Search, explore, and find the connections that can make you a more creative thinker.</p>\\n<p>Finally, one of our favorite features is what we call the “surprise me” button. Press it and Tangle presents you with something random you have captured in the past. Tangle’s canvas becomes a map whose destination changes at every click; you’ll never know what you might find. This functionality is an ideal way to inject some entropy into your workflow, aiding the creative process and splashing your working memory’s face with some cool water.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-mission\\\"><a href=\\\"#the-mission\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a><em>The mission</em></h3>\\n<p><strong>Our mission is to empower everyone to capture and connect their thoughts to create big ideas.</strong> </p>\\n<p>Tangle is merely the tool to help us achieve this goal.
