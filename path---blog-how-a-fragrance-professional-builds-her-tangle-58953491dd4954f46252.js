While the alpha version of the product is still a month from being ready, we figured there would be no harm in hearing what she thought of the prototype. After all, feedback is feedback and it was about time Tangle touched someone who was not its maker.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, Alice actually started using Tangle not just for a few minutes, but daily. After confirming with her that her use of our fledgling product was not because of romantic bias, I asked if she would allow me to interview about how she used it and what her experience was like. She happily agreed.</p>\n<p>Below is the transcript from our interview. I have cut some of the verbal superfluousness for brevity.</p>\n<h2 id="the-interview"><a href="#the-interview" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>The Interview</h2>\n<p><em>Myles</em>: What is your job title and what do you do on a day to day basis?</p>\n<p><em>Alice</em>: I am a Junior account executive at a big fragrance house in New York. I work with 11 perfumers who are briefed on different ideas that we receive from our clients to create the fragrances they want. My job is basically turning an idea our client has into a fragrance.</p>\n<p><em>Myles</em>: How does that process normally go?</p>\n<p><em>Alice</em>: I basically just relay what the client wants and brainstorm with perfumers all day. They are what we call the “nose”. What\'s really important is having a full understanding of all the different ingredients and how they interact with your palate. There are over 5,000 synthetic and natural ingredients that all create different fragrant accords. A fragrance will be made up of any number of ingredients. Fifty to one hundred twenty normally.</p>\n<p><em>Myles</em>: How do you keep track of all of these ingredients, smells, and clients?</p>\n<p><em>Alice</em>: Taking notes and cataloging of all the different smells and how they make you feel is really critical to my job. You actually perceive smells differently depending on your mood, so training your nose to recognize those smells and the ingredients is really important. Writing all your perceptions down is obviously a big part of that training, but I am always on the go so I need something I can just write stuff down in fast. I also need a good way of making sure I am keeping up with my clients and the smells and ingredients I am using for them.</p>\n<p><em>Myles</em>: So what kind of system do you use now and what has made you stick with Tangle over the past couple weeks of using it?</p>\n<p><em>Alice</em>: So I had those little notebooks with the tabs that correspond to a letter and I would write down all the ingredients and how they smelled and interacted with each other alphabetically. But it kind of got tricky when I started filling up a bunch of the notebook and when I wanted to write about more than one ingredient. Like how two ingredients combine to make a smell. I didn’t really have a great place to put it so I would write it on a sticky note. I know Tangle isn’t perfect yet, but I don’t have to do any kind of organizing anymore which is really nice. When I am at my desk and taking a note after a meeting or about an ingredient I am checking out, my old stuff that I wrote down about it pops up. It actually helps my memory a lot too. What I have been using it most for though, is keeping up with clients. I use it kind of like a CRM, except I just write about the client and put their name in the note I am capturing and it will just connect to the other notes about that client I have. And, if I have written about an ingredient and a client, all my notes about those two things pop up when I am searching for one or the other, which is really useful.</p>\n<p><em>Myles</em>: Do you use tags or any method of making sure your related notes and ideas that you drop into Tangle are connected?</p>\n<p><em>Alice</em>: Sometimes. So normally for client stuff I will just write their names and make sure they are spelled right. I noticed that if you don’t spell their name right it won’t connect. But, for ingredients, I use “hashtag ing” which means ingredients to me. When I search for “hashtag ing” or write a note using it, I get all my ingredient stuff automatically.</p>\n<p><em>Myles</em>: Cool - well thank you I really appreciate it.</p>\n<p>It was great to get Alice’s feedback as we continue to build toward our alpha release. We are excited that she got value out the connections Tangle surfaced. We continue to integrate new features like “fuzzy matching” to address the spelling issue she brought up.</p>\n<p>We are looking forward to putting Tangle in your hands soon.
