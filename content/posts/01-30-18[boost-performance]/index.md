A close friend who is now a senior developer at a large social network platform in Silicon Valley recently shared with me some some of the things that she feels have been the biggest contributors to her early success. I thought I would pass these along.

### Take ownership of the uncomfortable

Is there a new risky project with an unclear path? Is there an issue that nobody knows how to resolve? Don’t be scared and take it. You will stretch yourself. You may fail, but at the end of the day you will have learned way more than if you didn’t take it. Even in failure, this kind of action is rewarded by the best organizations - above all else, they appreciate driven individuals. If failure is shamed in these kinds of situations, perhaps that organization is not right for you...

The more you jump at taking ownership of bigger, scarier projects, the more high-importance work you will be given... allowing you to grow even more.

### Don’t hide weakness

While unbelievable now, my friend had a sense of imposter syndrome when first starting. As a fresh new college grad, she felt that her skills were not up to par, and worried that others (including the boss) would track her knowledge gaps and use them against her. This ended up being miles from the truth.

Nobody cares. In fact, most colleauges want to see you succeed!

Feeling scared and anxious about what you don't know actually hinders your ability to grow. Discover your what you don't, grab your shovel and start filling in your knowledge gaps by working hard. When you feel there is a gap too big to fill, ask questions! Never be scared to to ask for help, she says, it is the best way to learn and your colleagues will be appreciative.

### Sleep

Getting enough sleep is an obvious boon to critical thinking and mood, but is often neglected by fledgling 20 somethings in every industry. She stressed that getting enough sleep improved her performance on the job and she felt she was able to learn faster than some of her fatigued colleauges that had either stayed late to finish work or hit the bars in the Mission. She stressed that you of course need to have fun, but it was clear that some of her colleagues who came from better schools and had stronger backgrounds were not doing as well because they were simply tyring to do too much.

Sleep is your friend.

I personaly can relate to this message well. During my time as an investment banking analyst, almost all the junior employees were sleep deprived. This led to easily avoidable mistakes, that in turn made everyone even more cranky than when they woke up after a week topping four and a half hours of sleep.

Subtract off a couple hours from work and add them to sleep. You will think quicker and better, actually adding value to your company.
