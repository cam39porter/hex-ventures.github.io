Imagine your brain is a computer. You are ingesting data every second of your life. The data are all different formats: smells, sounds, feelings, sights. There is no process for you to store this data except to put it into folders on your hard drive. Soon enough, your RAM is exploding, you can no longer function, and you are forced to *delete, delete, delete*.

[In my last post](https://usetangle.com/blog-ai-meets-your-notebook) I discussed the strengths of a machine: they are great at processing problems with specific inputs, outputs and rules. A normal computer, though, would have a torrid time dealing with the problem of processing and storing the data of life, let alone enough physical hard drive space to store it.

In fact, human memory storage dwarfs that of a normal computer’s. [Estimates say we have the capacity for something like a quadrillion bytes.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-estimate-boosts-the-human-brain-s-memory-capacity-10-fold/) Your laptop holds on average 5 gigabytes. A quadrillion is 10¹⁵. A gigabyte is 10⁹. Your memory has a lot more bytes.

The problem your memory solves every day is not storing life’s data, but organizing it. You might think of the reason for your forgetfulness as your memory running out of space, a new memory pushes an old memory out, or that a memory was auto-deleted because “your startup disc is almost full.” *So frustrating!*

But that is not quite right.

Instead, think of your memory bank as a long shelf. The shelf can fit infinite memories on it. Each memory is searchable but takes a certain amount of time to retrieve. The time it takes is based on where it is placed and how much stuff is already on the shelf. A great memory organ has the most important memories right at the front, closest to you, so you can retrieve them quickly and easily. The less important stuff is further back. More forgotten and out of the way.

The flexibility of your mind is what allows you to judge what information to store and what not to store; forgetting things is paramount because it separates what is important and what is not. Forgetting is crucial for remembering, learning and, living.

### The forgetting curve

There is a mathematical function for how we forget things. It’s called the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve. It makes you remember that forgetting happens for a reason.

Hermann Ebbinghaus began studying memory in the late 19th century hoping to apply the same mathematical rigor of the physical sciences to the mind. He began by memorizing random strings of nonsense syllables and would test himself on those lists from previous days. He was able to quantify what we all know intuitively: the number of items one can accurately recall goes down as time passes. It looks like this:

His findings, however, left open many questions. Is this curve a good thing? And, why this curve in particular?

Not until about 30 years ago when a Carnegie Mellon professor named John Anderson was studying library retrieval systems did we have a breakthrough. His take on memory connected the principles of his two disciplines, computer science and psychology. He surmised that “the key to a good human memory becomes the same as the key to a good computer cache: predicting which items are most likely to be wanted in the future.¹”

> Your brain is good at predicting the future value of the data we ingest, and places it in your memory bank accordingly.

He came up with the shelf metaphor already mentioned, and conceptualized a good memory organ would be one that keeps handy memories closer to the front of the shelf, and pushes the less valuable memories further back, in essence *forgetting them.*

Anderson actually proved this by relating the curve to the real world. He and a colleague, Lael Schooler, performed Ebbinghaus-like studies not on human minds, but on society as a whole. His aim was to determine what patterns characterize the way the world itself “forgets” — the way that events and references fade over time. Anderson and Schooler looked at three human environments:

1. Headlines from the New York Times
2. Recordings of parents talking to their children
3. Anderson’s own email inbox

In all three domains, “a word was found to be more likely to appear again immediately after it had been used, and that the likelihood of seeing it again falls off as time goes on.” This finding is astounding. It showed that reality itself has a statistical structure that mimics the Ebbinghaus curve.

The way we forget things, then, is optimal. **Your memory is tuned precisely to the frequency of your surroundings, organizing your memory so that we are able to remember what’s useful when we most likely need it.**

Take a step back and chew on this for a moment. What if you could remember every second of every day that you have ever lived? Those memories were always at the very front of your memory bank, easily experienced again and again. Would you want that power? Or would it be a burden?

There are people that have this ability, and it is far from ideal for them.

Amanda Price is one of those people. She is the first person to be diagnosed with what is now known as Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory, or HSAM, a condition she shares with around 60 known others. In a [New York Times article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/feb/08/total-recall-the-people-who-never-forget), she describes how “she can remember most of the days of her life as clearly as the rest of us remember the recent past, with a mixture of broad strokes and sharp detail.”

HSAM makes traversing the metaphorical shelf too easy. Every bit of information is right at an afflicted person’s fingertips, just waiting to be surfaced.

> *It is, she says, like living with a split screen: on the left side is the present, on the right is a constantly rolling reel of memories, each one sparked by the appearance of present-day stimuli. With so many memories always at the ready, Price says, it can be maddening: virtually anything she sees or hears can be a potential trigger.*

This is paralyzing for Price. She lives in perpetual fear of any bad decision or hurtful experience because instead of learning and moving on from painful moments in her life, she continues to relive them.

An unfortunate superpower.

### Learn to forget

Forgetting keeps your memory from clutter, helps you to move on, and makes it easier to for your mind to function. Forgetting is core to living.

Reframing memory this way is helpful to rethink other things too. Particularly the opposite of forgetting, learning.

Learning is often confused with rote memorization — swallowing information for the sake of ingestion — which traditional schooling leans towards. Learning does not happen temporally. It is constant. It is not how much stuff we can cram into your noggin, but rather your ability to forget the extraneous, and synthesize information to the core points that are the true marks of learning.

[Tiago Forte](https://praxisblog.co/) puts it perfectly:

> *The brain never stops drawing relationships, making connections, and noticing correlations. You couldn’t stop learning if you wanted to. Knowing that our brain is continuously collecting information, our goal switches from remembering as much as possible, to forgetting as much as possible.²*

You don’t even have to remember to do it.
