## The It Would Be Cool If Series

This week I am starting a new series called “it would be cool if **\_\_\_**.” This series is going to be mainly made up of first-person stream of consciousness posts detailing technologies about which I am excited.

The first post is about one of my favorite burgeoning technologies: self-sovereign identity.

### It would be cool if I controlled my digital identity.

Every time I am online I am giving bits of myself away.

* My email

* My date of birth

* My gender

* My likes and dislikes based on my browsing behavior

* My attention

I bet companies like Facebook and Acxiom no more about me than I know about me. I bet the same is true for you as well.

It would be great if I did not have to give away my personal information, but instead provided access to it, when I want to, to whom I want. It would be nice to have a key, or token that I can lend, but always have the right to take back.

It would be really cool to participate economically in the marketing supply chain. I, perhaps controversially, really enjoy an actionable advertisement - one that might lead me to a purchase. I like to spend my money on great products, and if I am shown a great product that provides me utility, well that is just dandy.

Advertising networks and platforms need my data to serve me those great ads. Today they just take it - either through my browsing history (cookies), or the personal data they force me to enter it to use certain websites. However, much of the segmenting data they collect is inferred probabilistically. I google champions league scores and my IP address is in NYC so I probably like soccer and I might want to purchase New York Red Bulls tickets. I am served an NYRB ad.

Digital advertising companies see that I have purchased Rag & Bone jeans, buy 30 racks of beer once in a while, and use seamless a lot. They know other 20 something millennials also show these characteristics. I am therefore segmented as such and served ads that advertisers think I might like.

However, I’d love to invert this advertising paradigm. I currently get served ads that people think I like, but I really do not. The most frustrating of all is when I have already purchased a specific item, and then I am served ads to purchase it again immediately after. Ugh!

Here, let me lend you my data, all of it. Who I am, my age, my preferences, what I am in the market for, what I like to eat, my income level, the activities I like to do on the weekends. Note, lend, not give. I still control my data, and I can take away access at any time.

To rent my perfect data, you ma cherie, will pay me something. Whenever you take my attention, which will be often because you are now able to serve me amazing advertisements for products and experiences that I will almost certainly be tempted to buy, I should get something. After all, you make money off every click, and I am the enabler. Even cooler, you can now more accurately attribute what touchpoint in the advertising journey was the crucial one to my purchase decision. If you know that, you my ad serving guru executive genius friend, can charge more!

**Magic!**

Now to the next level. Let’s say I lend you my data for $X today. After a month of serving me advertisements you **know** I will like, I have purchased nothing. Well, according to the pricing laws of supply and demand, my information as a consumer is not as in demand anymore while the supply has remained constant. You, you little advertiser you, could negotiate my price down say 5%. Now my data is valued at $X(0.95). Now we are both happy again.

Property rights are sweet.

And even a level beyond that, sovereign digital identity actually expands a website domain's business model. A publisher could both pay me for my beautiful data _and_ offer me the option to not provide my data, but pay for their content. Many premium publishers like the Washington Post and New York Times are already doing this. Now you can optimize both of the traditional online business models: pay per click and subscription.

Welcome to a new, better attention-based economy.

So, it would be really cool if I could control my digital identity and data. I would like to permission it to you for a reasonable price. The investment on your part should pay off in spades.

Ok, so I really did not explain any technology specifically here, but that is on purpose. Many others are working on, or have explained this concept much better than I can, and in far more detail than I have time to describe.
