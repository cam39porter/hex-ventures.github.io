## The Knowledge Worker’s Dilemma

> Today’s knowledge workers need to be thinking and working like artists. Artists do not gain inspiration and begin creating from nothing. They are continually collecting tidbits from the world around them. These tidbits eventually become the catalyst for new artwork. Leonardo Da Vinci is a classic example of this. He collected thousands of moleskins worth of notes and inspiration, which turned into pieces of art like the Vitruvian Man and Salvator Mundi.

Knowledge workers, defined as professionals whose main capital is their knowledge, will continue to make up a higher percentage of the global workforce as technology replaces the manual laborer. Even more importantly, artificial intelligence will replace procedural knowledge worker tasks more and more, making one's unique creativity and knowledge even more crucial to their success. It is clear that knowledge worker competition will only increase. The new remote work paradigm will be an amplifier for that effect. Companies like TopTal have created marketplaces for knowledge worker talent: from financial analysts to strategy consultants to full-stack engineers. Knowledge workers are the new norm, and to succeed, they need to act like artists: collecting, capturing, connecting, and reflecting on their thoughts - then turning those thoughts into knowledge, the asset that makes them, as knowledge workers, valuable.

Creating knowledge is not an easy task for knowledge workers for a few reasons.

1. The modern knowledge worker does not have time for long-form note-taking. Throughout the day, the knowledge worker is doing something: she is reading, writing, creating documents in the Office suite, discussing, and collaborating.

2. The modern knowledge worker is flummoxed by the paradox of choice when taking a note. Where should I write the note? In what file do I put this note? How should I organize it? She finds it difficult to decide where to capture a thought or take a note and does not often have the time to organize or find the notes already produced.

3. When knowledge workers do capture their thoughts in a note, the notes they take and store are not dynamic. Digital note-taking applications today mimic the traditional pen-and-paper with the added benefit of text editing tools. There is no connective tissue between the things one writes. There has been recent activity from Evernote, in particular, to use AI to recommend tasks based on the user’s writings automatically. Evernote's usage of AI is interesting, but does not tackle the more significant problem: how to make it easy for knowledge workers (or anyone) to make connections between their trails of thoughts to inspire and surface new ideas.

The very act that reinforces and creates knowledge (reminder: a knowledge workers most valuable asset) takes time and is difficult to do: reflect on previous thoughts, ideas, and knowledge. The reason why this is hard is a function of problems 1-3, but providing a solution to promote reflection is another problem altogether.

The knowledge worker faces these three issues every day, whether they know it or not. As competition amongst knowledge workers continues to increase, these problems will become more and more amplified. Providing an application that can differentiate a knowledge worker by optimizing their primary asset will only increase in value.
