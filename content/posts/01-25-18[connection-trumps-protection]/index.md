## Dinner Conversation

I recently had dinner with some former colleagues, all of whom have been in both the financial and professional services industries for more years than I have been alive. We began to talk about how collaborative tools / knowledge management systems have never really worked at their firms (think boutique bank and big consulting).

I was surprised by their pessimistic view of these kinds of tools — I imagined they would add a lot of value at companies that generate revenue from their knowledge and ideas.
So, I prodded and asked why they felt this way...

> Collaboration and knowledge sharing doesn’t really work in practice. It’s just the way it is.

_Why?_

> Well, you know, the incentive structure doesn’t support it. Employees do not want others knowing what they know in an organization where salaries are structured with a base and revenue-based bonus.

_Hmm._

## My Take

1. The phrase: “It’s just the way it is,” makes me cringe. My subconscious translates it to “It’s just what everyone is comfortable with accepting”. However, in this case, avoiding a verbal kerfuffle was for the best.

2. In the long run, growing the pie is a more effective way to earn higher compensation than trying to cut a bigger slice.

3. Lastly, I began to think about what makes a professional services firm better than another. What is the formula that makes any organization great? Is it that they have the smartest employees who know a lot? Or, perhaps is it how these individuals are organized.

## The Rabbit Hole

The next day I went down a deep rabbit hole in pursuit of some semblance of an answer. The search was fruitful. I didn’t find any specific answers, per se, but rather organizing principles around which I could think about a company’s infrastructure, systems, and operations.

One concept I found particularly interesting was the notion of “mesh”. Mesh, the brainchild of Lisa Gansky, is a one-word descriptor for a company that focuses on shareability and leverages technology to track and derive value from customer data.

Put simply, a mesh is a sharing network — one in which there is a commodity that is shared, used, and shared again. Mesh networks becomes more useful and durable as more users are added to it. For example, the Airbnb network is strong because if one property owner unlists their home, plenty of options remain.

And, the network makes the company smarter as more users use it. Uber aggregates data on millions of rides a day to understand transportation trends, in turn helping them make informed strategic decisions.

Lisa’s concept of meshy describes companies that have been highly successful at leveraging a platform, scaling and ultimately, making money.

## An Insight

While listening to Lisa’s TED talk, however, it occurred to me that mesh could also describe the internal structure of a company. At its best, a company should act as a sharing platform — one that becomes stronger as more workers are added and smarter as more work is done.

In this instance, what is shared is not a service, but rather ideas, insights and knowledge.

The company becomes stronger, smarter and ultimately more valuable as the collective knowledge of the firm grows and becomes more connected.

Making the internal workings of a company meshy means developing a culture based on individual empowerment, collaboration and reflection. This is a big investment, and requires the right tools and organizational hierarchy that fit the needs of your business.

However, I believe the rewards can be immense. Constructing a meshy organization can propel a company towards achieving its goal of providing an excellent product, regardless of what that product might be. It is clear to me that connecting will always trump protecting - The more a company’s individuals are connected, no matter what the organizational chart looks like, the better that company can serve its clients.

**Our plan is to be our own kind of mesh, and help you become a mesh too.**
