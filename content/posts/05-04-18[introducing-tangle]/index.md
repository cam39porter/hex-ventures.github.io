## How we think

While the Information Age we live in has contributed greatly to the proliferation of knowledge and access to education, it has also proven to be a rather daunting place to live and work. We are constantly exposed to a deluge of media, all vying for our eyeballs’ attention. Such is the nature of the internet and connected devices.

And yet, a universal truth remains: each of us goes through life collecting, synthesizing, organizing, and storing information. In fact, we are consuming more information than ever before. In 2017, the average person in the United States spent 12 hours per day consuming media. That is half the day for those of you counting at home.

While that figure surely includes recreational activities, it nonetheless means we are processing information constantly. We can thank our gorgeous brain for that.

The way by which we accomplish this feat is unsurprisingly not like stacking books on a shelf or filing documents in a cabinet. Rather, we can think of our brain more like a [reservoir](https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/08/01/networked-knowledge-combinatorial-creativity/) in which we put information, insights, and ideas that in turn combine and fuse to form new ideas. Our knowledge is naturally combinatorial.

While we all would like a larger reservoir of knowledge in which to swim, its growth can also be daunting and cumbersome. The more that flows in, the deeper and more expansive it becomes, and with that expanse comes a greater need for the connective tissue that permits navigation.

That connective tissue, as it turns out, is not only a powerful framework, it is also an important element of how our brains function. A California Institute of Technology study found that general intelligence resides in many sub-structures throughout the brain, but it is the degree of connectedness of those regions that has the most effect on general intelligence scores. The brain’s ability to pull together disparate information is crucial to our problem-solving and creative abilities.

## Where we are today

The way we do knowledge management today is fragmented.

Some transplant their knowledge into personal knowledge management tools like note-taking apps, some store it in their emails, and others keep it scattered in Moleskines across their desk. Others bottle it in their heads, surely suffering from leakage.

The problem is that personal knowledge management tools are antiquated. Our note-taking software and even communication solutions mimic real-world stationery, folders, and filing cabinets. These structures are rigid and do not accurately reflect the connected way we think.

The diversity of subject matter and know-how each of us has is at an all-time high, yet our existing tool suite has not paid the appropriate attention to build the bridges and tunnels meant to **connect** the disparate segments of our minds. Without applications that offer an information architecture that stimulates linkages, both obvious and hidden, the chance for the fusing of old ideas to form new, and the connectivity that begets creativity, will remain muted.

## The problems

There are four primary motivations for why we need to rethink the management of what we know.

1. **Humans are bad at organizing information on their own.** Our tools today force us to store information as files in folders. Deciding where to put things so to find them later easily is time-consuming, let alone taking into account the act of finding it later. There are courses and thousands of articles published to prove it.

2. **Current tools restrict connections.** The mechanisms for saving our information are a manifestation of physical necessity in a digital environment. They act as silos rather than the connective tissue we need between what we write down. Humans are terrible at knowing the future, particularly how an idea or note one wrote might be useful today or a year from now. Why keep our thoughts, ideas, and writings trapped in a digital filing cabinet?

3. **The most valuable part of writing things down is coming back to them later.** This reflection is made difficult by the linearity of the knowledge management tools we have. There is no way to connect the new and the old, to draw relationships between what and whom we once knew and what and whom we know now. Our knowledge management tools shouldn’t suffer from recency bias.

4. **Knowledge work is the new norm.** Knowledge workers, people whose job involves handling or using information, will continue to make up a higher percentage of the global workforce as technology replaces manual laborer. Even more importantly, artificial intelligence will replace procedural tasks more and more, making one's unique creativity crucial to success. There will be ever increasing competition amongst knowledge workers. Knowledge workers are the new norm, and to succeed, they need to act like artists: collecting, capturing, connecting, and reflecting on their thoughts.

## So what is Tangle?

A solution for personal knowledge management in today’s world of information overload and overflowing reservoirs should be holistic and connected. It should give you the feeling of building an explorable map. It should frequently elicit the dopamine rush of the _Aha!_ moment. It should automatically connect your current thinking to the past and not only seal the cracks through which so many of our ideas slip but bring them back to the surface when helpful.

It should not only make you feel creative but make you _be creative_.

That is how it feels using Tangle. We are building it because we believe in empowering everyone to capture and connect thoughts to create bigger ideas.

[The Tangle team](www.usetangle.com/team) has been hard at work building our first iteration of Tangle, and we are incredibly excited to share it with you. At the beginning of July, we will be opening up our product for the first time to a select few. The aim of this release will be to get Tangle into the hands of you: the creators, the thinkers, the idea jotters, the note-takers, the freelancers, and of course, those that never found value in knowledge management tools before. We will be actively seeking feedback from you all, and we cannot wait to hear what you think.

If you would like to get early access, please do so by following this [link](www.usetangle.com).

Over the coming weeks, we will be keeping you updated on our progress and [any exciting news](www.usetangle.com/blog) fit to share.

This is just the beginning.

**We can’t wait to see how the Tangle community grows.**
