## Vannevar's Predictions

... were oddly prescient. In a 1945 article published in the Atlantic called ["As We May Think"](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/), the then Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, Vannevar Bush, outlined the first version of Google Glass, a more advanced encyclopedia that we might now call Wikipedia, as well as something he coined the Memex: "a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility."

These predictions were born from Bush's concern with the changing relationship between humanity and the sum of our knowledge. He hoped that these imaginary inventions would help solve the information overload problem that he felt even in 1945.

Bush lamented that our ability to distill valuable insight from "the record" was falling well behind the growth of published content. During the mid 20th century, developments in data storage were all the rage, but Bush saw another side to the equation: the need to place equal emphasis on how we _access_ information now stored on tiny discs. He writes:

> Mere compression [...] is not enough; one needs not only to make and store a record but also be able to consult it, and this aspect of the matter comes later. Even the modern great library is not generally consulted; it is nibbled at by a few.
> [...]
> The difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish unduly in view of the extent and variety of present-day interests, but rather that publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record. The summation of human experience is being expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was used in the days of square-rigged ships.

Considering 90% of the world's data was created over the last two years, the question of how we tap into our collective knowledge seems awfully pertinent. As more and more content is pushed at us through a multitude of channels, how do we curate what we watch, read, and listen to? Maybe even more importantly, how do we store our own thoughts and ideas related to that content when our mental RAM reads "DISC IS FULL"?

### Blazing trails

Bush came up with a contraption he coined, "Memex," which would theoretically provide a solution to this question. The Memex would help people "blaze trails" through their ideas and thoughts they capture in the device, keeping those trails for them so they could easily be found and accessed later. I do not usually like using block quotes (it's kind of lazy), but in this instance, I think it useful:

> The owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and properties of the bow and arrow. Specifically, he is studying why the short Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in the skirmishes of the Crusades. He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and articles in his memex. First, he runs through an encyclopedia, finds an interesting but sketchy article, leaves it projected. Next, in a history, he finds another pertinent item and ties the two together. Thus he goes, building a trail of many items. Occasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables of physical constants. He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his own. Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him.

> And his trails do not fade. Several years later, his talk with a friend turns to the queer ways in which a people resist innovations, even of vital interest. He has an example, in the fact that the outraged Europeans still failed to adopt the Turkish bow. In fact, he has a trail on it. A touch brings up the codebook. Tapping a few keys projects the head of the trail. A lever runs through it at will, stopping at interesting items, going off on side excursions. It is an interesting trail, pertinent to the discussion. So he sets a reproducer in action, photographs the whole trail out, and passes it to his friend for insertion in his own memex, there to be linked into the more general trail.

> Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified. The lawyer has at his touch the associated opinions and decisions of his whole experience, and of the experience of friends and authorities. The patent attorney has on call the millions of issued patents, with familiar trails to every point of his client’s interest. The physician, puzzled by a patient’s reactions, strikes the trail established in studying an earlier similar case, and runs rapidly through analogous case histories, with side references to the classics for the pertinent anatomy and histology. The chemist, struggling with the synthesis of an organic compound, has all the chemical literature before him in his laboratory, with trails following the analogies of compounds, and side trails to their physical and chemical behavior.

I really like how Vannevar thinks about memories, knowledge, and wisdom. He sees them as trails, or branches, always growing and relating to each other in different ways as new information is captured, distilled, and stored.

It reminds me of a tangle of vines through a trellis. As the vines grow, they wrap around each other to create a big, tangled mess. However, if you were to pull one stem out from the knot carefully, you'd be able to inspect it, discover from where it sprouted, and know what other branches it had touched. You might even find something hidden from sight where the untangled vine used to rest.

It is somewhat surprising that technology has not been able to bridge this divide yet. Our thoughts are structured one way, yet our data, knowledge, note, and file management systems another, forcing us to index these things alphabetically or chronologically.

_hmmm_

### A contemporary Memex?

I have tried to find a product or thing, that fits the Memex description Vannevar laid out 70 years ago, but have not been able to find one that checks all the boxes. It seems to me that the cell phone or perhaps an application on a cell phone could be a Memex, but the way we use handheld devices today - texting, browsing, Instagramming, tweeting, calling(?), snapping - does not necessarily lend itself to "trailblazing."

People should enjoy traveling back through their trails. We should feel delighted to discover _how_ we came to know something or someone - especially when there is so much information being flung at us everyday.

Lawyers ought to be able to easily connect two cases at a deeper level than just precedent citation. Chemists should be able to explore how they reached a formula for a new compound. Not only the elite, but regular shmos too should be able to reflect on what we know and how we came to know it by having a wander down our trails.

To conlcude, I will leave you with one last Vannevar quote:

> Presumably, man’s spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory.
