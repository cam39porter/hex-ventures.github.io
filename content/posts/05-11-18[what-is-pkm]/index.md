# What is Personal Knowledge Management? (3-part series)

*Following up on our [Introduction to Tangle](http://usetangle.com/blog-introducing-tangle) last week, we felt it would be important to write a bit more about the space we are tackling and how technologies, like Tangle, fit in.* 

## Part I: The Knowledge Society and the Landmarks of Today

### *Knowledge Management and the Knowledge Worker*

Before diving into personal knowledge management, let’s start with where it came from.

The term knowledge management, or KM for short, is thrown around a lot these days. It is particularly hot in the enterprise context, where companies are clamoring to keep their organization’s know-how organized, retrievable, and secure as employees jump from company to company at a higher rate than ever. There is no standard definition that we could find, but the [Knowledge Management World](http://www.kmworld.com/) one is simple and to the point:

> “Knowledge Management is the process of capturing, distributing, and effectively using knowledge.” 

The roots of KM go as far back as 1959 when Peter Drucker predicted [“the shift to a knowledge society”](https://hbr.org/2014/10/what-peter-drucker-knew-about-2020) in his book, *The Landmarks of Tomorrow*. He suggested the most valuable asset of the next century would be knowledge, ushering in an era in which people would generate value with their minds more than with their muscle. 

Subsequently, he surmised, making “knowledge work productive will be the great management task of this century, just as to make manual work productive was the great management task of the last century.”

He called the agents in our knowledge society, knowledge workers. Simply, [knowledge workers are workers whose main capital is knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker). Are you analyzing, planning, writing, compiling, calculating, interpreting, diagnosing, reading, monitoring, collaborating or assessing? If so, then you are most likely a knowledge worker. In the knowledge worker job market, one would use this capital to market themselves for a new job. Today, it is safe to say that Linkedin is the knowledge worker marketplace.

“Knowledge” remained highly academic until the 1990s, when the management consulting industry popularized it in an enterprise context. As the internet and information technology developed, consulting firms latched onto the idea that they could use intranets and other technologies to facilitate easier communication within their own corporation, which led to time and cost savings. Knowledge management, in essence, became an asset.

The realization that knowledge within a firm was the key driver for a firm’s growth gave rise to the need for new company cultures, taxonomies, content management, and ultimately technological systems to manage it all. Say hello to Salesforce and Atlassian.

### *Moving to Personal Knowledge Management*

Fast forward to 2018 and knowledge management is hotter than ever. Slack is *bloop-blooping* in my headset as a write this and CRM tools are being gobbled up by seemingly everyone. Maintaining corporate knowledge is a big priority. There is even a relatively new executive position at some companies called Chief Knowledge Officer. 

If you read last week’s post, [Introducing Tangle](http://usetangle.com/blog-introducing-tangle), you may have glanced the word personal preceding “knowledge management.” Personal knowledge management, or PKM for short, is a bit late to the scene and similarly to its older brother, does not seem to have a set definition. In general, it is centered around [two fundamental points](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ori.2009.11): 

> “Managing and supporting personal knowledge and information so that it is accessible, meaningful and valuable to the individual.”

And

> “Maintaining networks, contacts, and communities, as well as making life easier and more enjoyable by exploiting personal capital.” 

Personal KM can be further broken down into a collection of processes that a knowledge worker uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share knowledge in their day to day work activities. Where organizational KM frameworks optimize a firm’s output by attempting to both break down barriers between a company’s workers to facilitate knowledge share and erect barriers around the company to stop knowledge leakage, PKM provides a framework for the individual to increase productivity by optimizing what they already know and how they grow their knowledge base. 

PKM has garnered considerable interest in recent years as effaced by the many companies and individuals offering PKM best practices and productivity coaching, not to mention the massive personal productivity technology industry (we will touch on this particular piece in part II). 

There are five primary reasons for this relatively new interest in the space:

1. **Information overload.** As I described in the [last blog post](http://usetangle.com/blog-introducing-tangle), we are living in a world of ubiquitous content. We need a system to synthesize, store, combine, and transform this information into knowledge. 

2. **New Technology.** The advent of task management, note-taking, and mind-mapping software tools have subsequently made people interested in personal knowledge management and productivity practices. We believe, however, that there is still a long way to go until we truly come close to solving knowledge management in the Information Age.

3. **The freelance economy.** The 21st century has provided the knowledge worker the tools to be able to work from anywhere. In 2016, there were 55 million freelancers in the United States. That is or 35% of the workforce. Freelancers produce deliverables just like the average employee, but their status as “my own boss” often leaves them without the existing corporate infrastructure and incentives to be highly productive. PKM is a framework that can help the individual operate as effectively as a corporation.

4. **Hyper-competitive job market.** The rise of professional media sites like Linkedin means more availability of information on a higher supply of workers from which any company can choose. Being a productive knowledge worker is crucial to standing out. 

5. **Too much to do, too little time.** Employees are inundated with projects. David Allen, the author of [*Getting Things Done*](https://gettingthingsdone.com/), has realized that most workers complain about “too much to do,” and yet most couldn’t give you, in the moment, a complete and accurately defined inventory of what they’ve committed “to do” if their life depended on it.” It has become abundantly clear that today’s employees need knowledge management and productivity resources just as much as the freelancer, and maybe even more than the enterprise.

The onus is now on the individual more than ever to be a productive worker, just as Drucker predicted more than 50 years ago. Personal knowledge management is a burgeoning field because it attempts to answer the timely productivity question from a bottom-up perspective.

### *PKM: A Framework*

There are many different frameworks for PKM, but one of the ones we like best is from [Dr. Kirby Wright, author of Rethinking Knowlege Work](http://www.knowledgeresources.ca/about/). We subscribe to the framework because it does a good job including both [information management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_information_management) and knowledge management practices in a clear way. 

He describes four core areas of personal knowledge management dimensions with which knowledge workers engage on a daily basis to solve problems. 

1. Intensive analytical processes 

2. Accessing and applying information resources

3. Social interactions and collaboration

4. Continuous learning

Each of us approaches these four dimensions of how we work in different ways; our practices are influenced by our personalities, strengths and weaknesses, social factors, and our organization’s (if part of one) culture and context. The four domains are synthesized below:

These four dimensions do not appear in isolation; they are contextual, combinatorial, and are enabled by our individual and social capacities. Moreover, our problem-solving competencies, and therefore PKM tendencies, are affected by a multitude of factors, including how novice or expert one is, as well as personality, internal motivation, and education. The ability for knowledge workers to develop relationships and find common interests and understandings is also important to how one operates in the grid.

The PKM space today has used these principles around which to develop tools and methodologies to best support the productive worker. [*Getting Things Done*](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) is the original manifesto of PKM and productivity best practices, followed by many other productivity and PKM practitioners like [Tiago Forte](http://learn.fortelabs.co/) and [Steven Johnson](https://medium.com/@stevenbjohnson).  

These practitioners have latched onto productivity products to help promote their techniques. There are now thousands of PKM products like task managers, note-taking apps, and mind mapping tools. These tools, and the companies that built them, have garnered a fervent following of users. Look no further than Evernote’s forum to find thousands of ardent note-takers arguing over folders and tags. 

In the next post, we will dive into these tools, how they function, what value they provide, and where they could be improved.
