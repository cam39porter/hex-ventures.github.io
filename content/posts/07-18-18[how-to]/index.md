**Hi there!** 

This page is the dedicated "How-to Guide" for Tangle. We will be updating it as we roll out new features and will let you when we do!

### Taking a note

- Click the big orange plus button in the top left or the "Create a new note" button on the right of the home screen and get writing!
- You can use all the normal rich text editing shortcuts or use markdown -- there is a Markdown cheat sheet at the bottom of the editor  

### Importing from Evernote

- You can import notes from Evernote by going to your Evernote app on your computer and selecting a notebook or notes you would like to have in Tangle
- In Evernote, Click File --> Export notes --> Save (make sure format is set to HTML)
    - Here is an [in-depth walkthrough from Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-export-Evernote-notes)
- Then, head to Tangle and click the upload button in the navigation bar on the left (it looks like an up arrow)
- Then, select the HTML files you just exported from Evernote and voila!
    - Two things to note:
        - The maximum amount of data you can import to Tangle is 1MB/note or 50MB total
        - Images are not supported by Tangle yet

### Searching

- Search for anything your heart desires in the search bar in the top right-hand corner
- You can also search without leaving your writing experience

 ### Visualizing your connections

- Related notes will begin to appear on the right-hand side of a note you are writing as soon as Tangle finds a connection!
- Click Visualize at any time -- on the home screen, on a given note, or search results -- to visualize the connections between your writing
