This story is going to be a weaving one, so bear with me.

It begins with Cole and Cam forcing me to participate in a company book club…

Sorry, sorry, let me rephrase. Cole, Cam and I started a book club recently (I know, right? Nerds!). We are attempting to read a (portion) of a book or article every week and spend 30 minutes first thing Monday morning to talk about our takeaways. The first book we decided to read was Cameron’s choice:[Why Information Grows](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TT1VLAO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). In the book, the author, Cesar Hidalgo, defines information as physical in nature and uses an information-centric lens to define why different economies and countries are successful, or not. It was a thought-provoking piece of literature and I highly recommend reading it.

I think the most interesting part of our group discussion about the book was around what Cesar calls “crystallized imagination”: the idea that the products we create are bits of physical information encoded with human thinking - essentially, economic outputs. What contributes to these physical outputs are inputs like raw materials and labor. Classic Econ 101.

The conversation transformed into a discussion about our own individual outputs. Our ideas, our work deliverables, our own literature, and how we treat others. These products become other people’s inputs, and by default, inform their outputs. Not only what their outputs are, but their quality, too.

It was a great conversation and made me rethink my initial reluctance to join the book club. In fact, the discussion, along with a call we received from a dear friend, Julian Griggs, made me rethink a lot of things, including this blog. This blog is our output and my baby. Once a week, for a few hours, I will curate this so-called newsletter and schedule it to be sent to all of you who unknowingly signed up for the blog by sheer luck of being my friend (haha). It’s content then becomes your input, you read it, internalize it and might think about it for a day, or a while. In Julian’s case, Will Minshew’s [personal constitution], as well as [Maria Popova’s Networked Knowledge and Combinatorial Creativity](https://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2011/08/01/networked-knowledge-combinatorial-creativity/) were inputs that caused him to call us during the middle of the day on Sunday. He said something along the lines of...

> _Guys, I read not only the blog and the article but ended up spending the whole day reading and writing about other articles that I discovered because of them. I really want to start a thread in which we can easily share thoughts on these kinds of writings._

Of course, we agreed to his proposal, and Julian sent us his reaction to another Popova article on [Erich Fromm’s “paradox of freedom,”](https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/04/17/erich-fromm-escape-from-freedom/) an article he found on brainpickings.org. If you’d like, you can see what Julian wrote [here](https://hex-ventures.github.io/hex-ventures/blog/paradox-of-freedom/), my response, and another response from Cole.

What started out as a book discussion turned into a much deeper dialogue on how each of us curates our inputs. I asked myself, what inputs am I consuming daily? How can I ensure these inputs are the highest quality? From whom and where do the best inputs originate? How can I get closer to them? And, what inputs are most influential to my outputs?

Just like your body processes food and turns its nutrients into usable outputs like energy and waste, our mind processes information and turns its content into knowledge that we can then use. It has become clear to me that in the Information Age we live in, curating the content we consume is incredibly hard. Our social media feeds are diluted with bullshit half of CNN’s website is clickbait, and the news we see on TV is inherently biased toward whichever pole that channel leans on the conservative-liberal spectrum.

I took action today to help myself curate my inputs a little better. I moved Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat to a folder on the last page (4th) on my home screen and completely disabled notifications on each. I will still check them occasionally for a humorous meme or if my future wife has finally chosen to DM me, but I think their place in the order of my inputs is better off in the background, rather than the foreground. I haven’t decided what I am going to replace them with (Snapchat and Instagram were on my home screen). I am thinking of a random fact generator, or perhaps the Medium app. I'll figure it out, but if you have any suggestions let me know!

To finish up, I want this blog to be a quality, positive input for all of you. An input that you process, if you choose to open it, and which may compel you to produce a positive, quality output. That output can be anything. Perhaps it stays personal, maybe you share it. Perhaps it is as small as a note to a friend, or perhaps it is as big as your own blog.

You decide. Just remember that your inputs become your outputs, and your outputs become others’ inputs.
