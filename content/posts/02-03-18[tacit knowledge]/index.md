## We are what we know

Humans, groups, and companies are a function of what they know. The more they know, and the more easily their knowledge is documented and shared, the better the organization will function.

Simple.

So, where do we start?

Let's start with the brain.

### The Neocortex is pretty great

Tim Urban at [Waitbutwhy](https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html) wrote a fantastic summary on how the world has been shaped over hundreds of millions of years and how humanity became the colossus it is today. It is a great read and I recommend it to anyone who has forty five minutes to invest in themself.

The development of the Neocortex allowed humans to share what they had learned. When the Neocortex advanced to the point that humans could symbolically refer to a thing with a sound, it opened up a whole new world of possibilities.

We could now tell someone about how to make a fire, fix a roof, or how to make a spear for fishing.

Huzzah! Knowledge could now be shared, and with this breakthrough, each generations' starting point of knowledge became where the last one left off.

### The Brothers Knowledge

So, our Neocortex gave us the ability to capture and share what we learn through language. But, that is not the only way knowledge is transferred.

> There are two kinds of knowledge. They are kind of like brothers:

#### Explicit knowledge

Explicit knowledge is systematic. It can be easily communicated, shared, and documented.

Music, books, math formulae, videos, podcasts, and anything else that can be stored, retrieved, and learned can be considered explicit.

#### Tacit knowledge

Tacit knowledge, on the other hand, is hard to formalize and capture. It is knowledge created by experiences, insights, intuitions, and observations. Being good at selling, for example, would be tacit knowledge. Acting with the proper etiquette at a traditional Chinese meal would also be tacit - you learn these things via experiences and your own natural intuitions.

### Capturing the little things

We at Hex believe that while many tools have been developed to help capture explicit knowledge - Microsoft Office, Evernote, etc - the way we organize and share that explicit knowledge can still be made much more efficient. Optimizing the ability for a group of people to share what they know will allow them to learn and progress as a collective much faster.

Tacit knowledge has for the most part been viewed as uncapturable. We do not necessarily disagree, but where we see opportunity is to provide a place for people to save "the little things".

Insights, tid-bits of knowledge and experiences that do not necessarily belong in documents could potentially be stored another way.

**We at Hex are working on untangling group knowledge so that more non-actionable ideas become actionable.**
