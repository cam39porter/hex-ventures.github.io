In our last [Problem Series post](https://hex-ventures.github.io/hex-ventures/blog/problem-series-silos), we discussed the problems with linear thought silos and why they make connecting the dots between notes so difficult. In this week's blog post, we build on this narrative to explore why the current state of note-taking applications make forming the habit of reflection so hard.

## What the heck does _reflection_ mean?

Great question. Thank you for asking.

Reflection in this context means _the act of revisiting old thoughts_ and can serve a number of purposes:

1. Help you to remember either a specific thought or the context around why you captured that thought
2. Provide you clarity on your current state of emotions or thinking
3. Connect the dots between two disparate, but related ideas that you have had

Reflection ultimately is like taking what we call a "mental shower." You feel refreshed and clear-headed. You have filled in the gaps of your memory and may have added more critical thinking to something you are working on. It's like wiping the sleep out of your eyes.

## My favorite reflection

Spotify's year-end reflection is all kinds of awesome. My friends and I love revisiting jams we have played throughout the year. We like the nostalgia of it. We love the sharability. We like seeing how our tastes change and, for me at least, how the songs we play inform a time in our lives and vice versa.

The Spotify mental shower is oh so refreshing.

See? Reflection is cool.

## Why current note-taking tools make reflection hard

Information stored linearly or organized by a person inherently requires work. The user must curate and organize their files and folders _and_ go back through all of them just get the water running from their mental shower head.

The real world manifestation of this is a notebook. You literally have to turn the pages – sometimes for a while – to achieve that feeling of reflection. Personally, the process is even worse in Evernote, email and other note-taking silos where you have to click through folders to find what you are looking for.

We believe reflection should be incredibly easy. Reflection should be a service – like the one Spotify provides. Reflection should be a habit, but current tools do not make that habit easy to form or make permanent.
