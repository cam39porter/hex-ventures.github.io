Students look back at their notes to study, writers look back at their notes for inspiration, and professionals look back at their notes to just make sure they have the facts right. Everyone ought to take notes, even on the little things like their ideas and what they are thinking about. Doing that exercise can often lead to powerful insights and connections that might have slipped through the cracks otherwise.</p>\n<p>To frame the problem, however, we have to start with the types of people in the world. Broadly, you can think of them as the Myles-type and the Cameron-type.</p>\n<h3 id="myles-types"><a href="#myles-types" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Myles-types</h3>\n<p>These types of people were never able to form good habits around taking notes or keeping a journal. They often tried, but it just never seemed to work out. They would go search for something they had written down and couldn\'t find it in their files and folders. Myles-types are not very good at self-curation and that discourages them from writing down their thoughts as notes.</p>\n<h3 id="cameron-types"><a href="#cameron-types" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Cameron-types</h3>\n<p>These types of people are great note takers. They are organized, abide by standard naming conventions, and enjoy going back through their journals and notes to connect the dots. Cameron-types are good at self-curation and that makes note-taking valuable for them.</p>\n<p>These two types of people inform how we think about the problems in current personal knowledge management systems and where we think they can be improved.</p>\n<h3 id="we-identified-3-primary-issues"><a href="#we-identified-3-primary-issues" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>We identified 3 primary issues</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Notes are siloed</strong></p>\n<p>We write our thoughts down wherever is most convenient at that time - meaning everywhere. Many people I have interviewed say they jot down thoughts in their email and send it to themselves, while also keeping notes in Word documents and note taking apps. This makes it very difficult to holistically keep track of all your thoughts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Self-curation is not easy</strong></p>\n<p>Particularly if you are a Myles-type, keeping your notes organized in files and folders is time consuming and doesn\'t always work out. Even Cameron-types would probably say they spend too much time making sure they know where everything is. Curating your notes also almost necessitates recency bias being injected into your organizational structure. The notes you took two years ago are lonely!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Connecting the dots is work</strong></p>\n<p>The practice of going back through your notes, re-reading, and digesting things again is great mental hygiene and helps to frame your thoughts. To complete this exercise though, you first have to remember to do it, and then you have to do it. Those two steps are work. Shouldn\'t our note-taking technology help us to remember and surface our path of thinking?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id="these-are-the-kinds-of-questions-the-group-at-hex-is-thinking-about-just-one-part-of-the-larger-knowledge-management-equation"><a href="#these-are-the-kinds-of-questions-the-group-at-hex-is-thinking-about-just-one-part-of-the-larger-knowledge-management-equation" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>These are the kinds of questions the group at Hex is thinking about.
