Deciding in milliseconds what words would be best to convey a desired meaning is difficult! </p>\n<p>These kinds of problems are <em>ill-defined</em>.

Programming a machine with clear inputs, outputs and rules allows it to solve incredibly complex math problems in milliseconds. A difficult calculus problem might seem daunting to us, but the machine eats it up.</p>\n<p>To distill the point, human brains are great at <em>matching patterns</em> we see everyday to solve problems that are not clearly definable. Machines excel at executing processes to solve problems with a clear set of inputs, outputs, and rules. And it is us, the machine’s creator, that creates the processes the machine uses to solve them.</p>\n<h3 id="but-that-paradigm-is-changing"><a href="#but-that-paradigm-is-changing" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>But that paradigm is changing.</h3>\n<p>Machine learning and artificial intelligence are making machines more flexible, <em>more human</em>. The advent of these technologies improve their ability to solve ill-defined problems. It also means the processes by which machines solve problems, well-defined or not, are no longer designed entirely by humans. The machines learn from the output of a problem and augment their processes accordingly.  </p>\n<p><em>Hence the name, machine learning.</em></p>\n<p>Machine learning models and a slew of intelligent humans are empowering machines to take over for people in many areas previously thought impossible. Just check out Google’s assistant in the video below.</p>\n<div>\n          <div\n            class="gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper"\n            style="padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;"\n          >\n            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JvbHu_bVa_g" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen style="\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          "></iframe>\n          </div>\n          </div>\n<p>The technologies that make this sci-fi a reality are not exclusive to the biggest companies. They are available to be used by all. Tangle uses them too.</p>\n<p>The problem Tangle tackles is one of <strong>note discoverability</strong>. It is currently difficult, time-consuming, and often frustrating to surface the useful notes in our notebooks that might be helpful to us at any given time. </p>\n<p>The root of the problem starts with the technology. Today’s note-taking apps are designed as digital storage buckets. They require diligent organization and tender care if we aim to keep the information in those buckets easily findable and accessible.</p>\n<p>Note-discovery is considered an ill-defined problem. Its inputs are vague. Should we only consider the data in each note, or perhaps the context under which we wrote the note as well? And what of outputs? Are we looking for just one related item, or many? How do we <em>know</em> if the surfaced notes are in fact the most related? Finally, the rules are completely subjective. Perhaps one person may draw connections between notes that others would not. </p>\n<p>Fear not. Applications of machine learning, like <a href="https://blog.algorithmia.com/introduction-natural-language-processing-nlp/">natural language processing</a>, help Tangle learn to be more flexible, making it capable of aiding humans in the note discovery process.</p>\n<p>Tangle’s algorithm searches for, and returns, the set of notes it thinks are related. Right now it understands matching people, places, and things. For example: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“machine learning” = “machine learning”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“Albert Einstein” = “Albert Einstein”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It has been trained to the point where it is smart enough to know <em>not</em> to return a note because it contains <em>any</em> matching word. “The” and “the” would be an unhelpful match. What we want are the important ones. Tangle’s algorithm picks out salient notes, suggesting bits of information that are obviously related, and helpful, but also suggests things we have forgotten or did not realize were related in the first place. In this way, Tangle acts not only as a memory aid, but an idea generator as well.</p>\n<p>With time, Tangle will grow smarter. We can hone its model in a number of ways so that it suggests only the best content possible. One example is to train Tangle using an ontology. For example:</p>\n<p><strong>Tiger --TYPE<em>OF--> Cat --TYPE</em>OF--> Mammal --TYPE_OF--> Animal</strong></p>\n<p>Capture a note on a tiger and Tangle immediately pulls up my previous notes on tigers and the cute cat videos I may or may not have watched a couple months ago. There are many more possibilities.</p>\n<h3 id="a-friendly-machine"><a href="#a-friendly-machine" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>A friendly machine</h3>\n<p>Tangle lifts a frustrating problem off of our shoulders so we can focus on the elements of work that are most important: reading, writing, creating, and understanding. The connections it generates are also <em>helpful</em>. They help us to perform our work more creatively, help generate ideas, and keep our memories fresh. </p>\n<p>Until now, note-taking apps have required the burden of connecting old information to the present to fall on you. We think it\'s time to change that.</p>\n<p>We are just beginning to explore the possibility of AI and machine learning in our notebooks.
