Almost every knowledge worker today uses some form of note-taking, task management, or mind-mapping software on a daily basis. Yet, for the thousands of these apps developed, and the millions of users that interact with them, they look largely the same as they did ten years ago.</p>\n<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/usetangle-static-assets/blog/onenote.png" alt="OneNote"></p>\n<p><em>OneNote in 2017 (left) vs 2005 (right)</em></p>\n<p>This is problematic. Knowledge work is the present and the future; technologies that manage and optimize what we know are paramount to the success of the 21st century worker; from software engineers to freelance designers to strategy consultants. Tools for externalizing our thoughts, ideas, meeting notes, and task lists must keep up with the rigorous demands of knowledge work. Knowledge management software should make the worker more productive, more intelligent, and more creative than before.</p>\n<p>The users of these products are demanding more too. Go to the forums for many of the top note-taking software sites and you will find feature requests, bug reports, and complaints from passionate users who insert their most prized intellectual possessions into their digital thought repositories. It is clear that there is plenty of room to innovate and improve.</p>\n<h3 id="a-skeuomorphic-legacy"><a href="#a-skeuomorphic-legacy" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a><em>A skeuomorphic legacy</em></h3>\n<p>One design element that you can find in almost any personal knowledge management tool is skeuomorphism. Skeuomorphic design takes cues from the real-world and is themed to be reminiscent of a more physical experience. Look no further than Google Keep, Evernote, or OneNote and you will see the digital manifestation of the physical; a pixelated sticky note, tabular binder, or notebook.</p>\n<p>Skeuomorphic design does have its benefits. It is fun, makes the user interface tactile, and is accessible. It provides the user with an intuition about how the underlying system works; if a user writes notes in a file, she will probably know to save it in a folder. Easy and user-friendly.</p>\n<p>However, skeuomorphism also presents challenges. By transplanting physical designs onto the screen, we aren’t necessarily optimizing for a digital environment, but rather for familiarity. Making an interface friendly and the user experience delightful are aspirations for which technologists ought to strive, but design should be executed to empower the end user, not in the name of the technology.</p>\n<p>We feel this distinction is incredibly important and has been missed by many within the PKM space. What is the goal at hand? What is the point of a note-taking tool? We believe the answer should be an external system that helps the user be more prepared, innovative, and creative. A legal pad certainly helps in the physical realm, but it’s also limited by the very domain it is meant for; why chain ourselves to desk artifact UX and UI design?</p>\n<h3 id="linear-organization"><a href="#linear-organization" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a><em>Linear organization</em></h3>\n<p>In fact, the skeuomorphic design that has widely dominated PKM tools, particularly of the note-taking variety, has been a primary contributor to UX principles that, we believe, move the technologies further away from their goal.</p>\n<p>The principle to which I am referring is <strong>linear organization.</strong></p>\n<p>Users are forced to organize the content they produce within PKM tools in order to make the information useful. The onus is on the user to know where that input should go. This is rather self-defeating: by siloing a thought, information, or notes in a named folder, that input has no opportunity to connect or socialize with anything that may be related to it. This leaves the responsibility on the user to remember what other content they have that is related to what they are thinking about now. Humans, unfortunately, aren’t great at remembering.</p>\n<p>Because of the organizational responsibility on the user, most PKM tools necessarily present the output linearly, or in lists. Files are in lists, which are in notebooks, which are in folders, which are also listed in other folders and so on. Listing thoughts out chronologically or alphabetically can be useful, but it is impossible to build a true “second brain” without visually emphasizing the relevant connections between the thoughts the user has plucked from their head.</p>\n<h3 id="a-fragmented-landscape"><a href="#a-fragmented-landscape" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a><em>A fragmented landscape</em></h3>\n<p>Below is a visual representation of how we see the PKM tool landscape based on the principle described above. The coordinates we have chosen are meant to be relative; there are thousands and thousands of applications that do similar things, so we have done our best to choose representative ones.</p>\n<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/usetangle-static-assets/blog/pkm-landscape.png" alt="landscape"></p>\n<p>You’ll notice that most tools fit on the left bottom half of the graph. They are organizationally intensive and linearly presented. Task managers, note-taking apps, and mind-mapping software as we know them all require organizational decisions. Tags, folders, labels, notebooks, projects; the list goes on.</p>\n<p>There is a subset of note-taking applications out there that emphasize quick content capture over general organizational capabilities. These look like Write Now, an Android App that allows you to swipe across the screen to open a pop-up note pad, and Papier, a Chrome plug-in that opens a note-taking interface whenever you press Command + T in the browser. These too, are highly linear.</p>\n<p>Mind-mapping tools are the only group that fits above the x-axis. They allow the user to view the inputs in non-linear ways, hence why they are called “mapping” tools. They are great for visualizing a plan, network, or connecting related thoughts to a central idea. Mind maps are useful if you have plenty of time to curate a nice looking bubble chart, but for most of us who are constantly on the go, they are only used occasionally.</p>\n<h3 id="tangle"><a href="#tangle" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a><em>Tangle</em></h3>\n<p>Finally, you will notice that the Tangle logo rests rather lonely in the top-right quadrant. That is because we are doing things slightly differently. We are creating a tool that mirrors how we think and, while easy to use, stays away from skeuomorphic paradigms and linear organization. Instead, Tangle grants connectivity first-class citizenship. Instead of making the user responsible for organizing their content into linear hierarchies, Tangle connects what you are capturing now with your entire existing corpus of knowledge, as well as any piece of information you may acquire in the future. Instead of showing you lists, it shows you connections, both obvious and unobvious. We are very excited to help herald a much-needed paradigm shift in knowledge management.</p>\n<p><strong>Check out our next post to read more about how Tangle is different than the rest.</strong></p>',timeToRead:5,excerpt:"In  our last post , we described a general framework for personal knowledge management, its history, and how it has changed.
