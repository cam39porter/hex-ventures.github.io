Communicating effectively is really hard. When we working at Tangle, headphones are often on and we are locked in. Particularly when Cameron and Cole are coding, conversation takes a back seat. I am researching, creating materials, editing copy, or talking with potential users. It’s hard to stay on the same page even as a three person team. A lot of it has to do with trying to move fast. It’s hard to hear each other when you are each in your own B-52.</p>\\n<p>We learned the consequences of this the hard way, as I think many people, not just founders do too. A few weeks ago, it became clear that the pain points each of us thought Tangle would solve were different. I thought one thing, Cameron another, and Cole a hybrid. Our vision for the company was not in sync. How the in the world could that happen?</p>\\n<p>It took 14 hours of conversation to realign Tangle’s stars. We lost a full day. I remember in my two other jobs in finance and consulting similar, but less severe situations occurring.</p>\\n<p>“Wait, you aren’t working on updating the cap table?” I remember an associating asking me during my analyst days.</p>\\n<p>“No, was I meant to be?” Was not the right response.</p>\\n<p>So, how can you over-communicate, whether it be on the vision of a product, goal-setting or task management? Share early and share often. Information symmetry allows everyone to act optimally. The more optimally your colleagues can act, the better the work product, and (theoretically) the more money the company will make. That is good for everyone.</p>\\n<p>One thing we have done at Tangle to help this is move our goals, tasks, product documents, and user pain points out of the digital and onto whiteboards that are in plain site. Things get lost in shared drives. You forget to look at them, organize them, and update them. All of a sudden they are stale and your vision for what you are doing is blurry.</p>\\n<p>Keeping a written, explicit explanation of our goals for the week and month, our product vision and principles, and what problems the product solves in plain site keeps them permanently top-of-mind. It allows us to constantly be questioning what we are doing with the bigger picture in mind.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"read\\\"><a href=\\\"#read\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Read</h3>\\n<p>I never used to read. It was never a habit I formed outside of being forced to do it for school. What a shame.</p>\\n<p>One reason I never formed the habit was because reading seemed like work. Work that was always more scary than watching or listening to stuff. It is probably because reading is active. Watching and listening are passive. The marginal extra benefit of reading a book, though, far outweighs the marginal cost. I wish I understood those economics earlier.</p>\\n<p>Tangle has a book club, and that book club has helped me to form the healthy habit of reading. We read a book every two weeks or so and spend 30 minutes discussing it via a Slack call or in-person if we are all together. That exercise alone has brought me immense learning. It has made me more interesting and thoughtful at work. I have found myself often applying learnings from the books we read to my deliverables. It has also made me more interesting in my social life. It turns out that dating a guy that reads is “sexy.” Who knew.</p>\\n<p>Here is a smattering of the books I have read with the group and by myself:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TT1VLAO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&#x26;btkr=1\\\">Why Information Grows</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Brotopia-Breaking-Boys-Silicon-Valley-ebook/dp/B074LQKJJC/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&#x26;ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1529688319&#x26;sr=1-1&#x26;keywords=brotopia+breaking+up+the+boys%27+club+of+silicon+valley\\\">Brotopia</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078FZ9SYB/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&#x26;btkr=1\\\">Measure What Matters</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-30th-Anniversary-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B0090RVGW0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&#x26;ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1529688417&#x26;sr=1-1&#x26;keywords=on+writing+well\\\">On Writing Well</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup/dp/152473165X\\\">Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Start-up</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions-ebook/dp/B015CKNWJI/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&#x26;ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1529688541&#x26;sr=1-1&#x26;keywords=algorithms+to+live+by\\\">Algorithms to Live By</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People-ebook/dp/B003WEAI4E/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-text&#x26;ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1529689868&#x26;sr=1-3&#x26;keywords=how+to+win+friends+and+influence+people\\\">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3 id=\\\"write\\\"><a href=\\\"#write\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Write</h3>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That’s why it’s so hard.” - David McCullough</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>I do a lot of writing now. More than ever, actually. More than in high school and more than in college, where I wrote constantly for class assignments.</p>\\n<p>I always liked writing, but never knew how hard it was. I think this is because I never <em>actually</em> wrote well.</p>\\n<p>The better you can write about something, the better you understand something. The better I understand Tangle’s go-to-market strategy, our future customer’s pain points, the technology that Cameron and Cole are implementing to solve them, and even my own frustrations the better I can write about them. So I am practicing. Practicing everyday.</p>\\n<p>I am sure you are busy. I am sure there are many things ahead of writing in your personal stack ranking. My recommendation is to move “spend time writing,” up on that list. No matter what you do, writing about it will help clarify your thoughts.</p>\\n<p>I wish I wrote more about the problems I was tackling on behalf of my client during my consulting engagement. I was acting as a go-between evaluating a partnership with a company using blockchain technology to solve advertising fraud. Spending time writing coherently about what the heck a blockchain is might have helped my client better understand the opportunity and how to move forward.</p>\\n<p>The more you can write things down in a clear and concise manner, the more clearly you can think. I have found it is a lot like flexing a muscle. The more you do it, the stronger and more flexible that muscle will become. Try writing.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"make-the-most-of-lulls\\\"><a href=\\\"#make-the-most-of-lulls\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Make the most of lulls</h3>\\n<p>In every job there are lulls. Even a founder’s.</p>\\n<p>There are times that I am blocked. Cole taught me that word. You probably intuitively know what blocked means, but to be clear, it is when someone else is still working on something that needs to be complete for you to finish what you are working on. I currently can’t finish writing a guest post for a productivity blog because we haven’t finished a UI revamp and we want to insert some GIFs of the product. I am blocked.</p>\\n<p>You can make the most of lulls and blocks, however. I never used to think about this and wish I did. I bet at your job there are times during the day where you just aren’t doing much. How do you spend that time? Just think about the low hanging fruits you could pick when you are “chilling at work.” I bet there are a bunch and I bet they will taste sweet. I have no specifics to recommend here except to think about this the next time it happens.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"always-have-a-goal-in-mind-for-meetings\\\"><a href=\\\"#always-have-a-goal-in-mind-for-meetings\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Always have a goal in mind for meetings</h3>\\n<p>This lesson comes from a specific situation, but is so relevant. Cameron and I (Cole was in SF at the time) had a meeting with a partner at a venture capital firm. We had already met with him once before and this follow-up was meant to be somewhat of an update chat.</p>\\n<p>We didn’t go into the meeting with a clear goal, however, and when our 30 minutes was coming to an end, I found myself stuttering after he asked “So what can I be helpful with?”</p>\\n<p>Cameron saved the day by jumping in, but we both came away from the meeting knowing we had screwed up.</p>\\n<p>Have a goal in mind when you have a meeting, no matter how formal or informal. Meetings can be such a &#x26;*#@. They take you away from your work and are often more costly than helpful. The other party (or parties) will appreciate your clear intentions and your conversations will be much more effective too.</p>\\n<p>“Catching-up” just isn’t a useful reason to meet during a work day. Friends do that on Saturday afternoons in the park. It is a really easy thing to do, but I think a lot of people screw it up, including me.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"get-out-of-the-weeds\\\"><a href=\\\"#get-out-of-the-weeds\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Get out of the weeds</h3>\\n<p>This tidbit is an offshoot of the first five learnings but I think it deserves its own section.</p>\\n<p>It is incredibly difficult to think about something really hard, to research it, to write about it, and to constantly be talking about it without getting lost. Work is a process. There is a big difference, though, in simply being a part of the process, and understanding why you are part of the process and <em>why</em> that process is in place.</p>\\n<p>For example, this blog post is part of my process. I write one per week. The process began because we thought writing blog posts and sharing them would help attract a following of sorts. A marketing tool and a useful way to stay in touch with those that might be interested in what we are doing.</p>\\n<p>Recently though I got lost. Why I was writing was no longer clear. All I could see were trees, no forest. I recalibrated by asking Cameron and Cole why they thought I was writing the blog posts. It was a great exercise and helped me to regain my perspective. It also unveiled a problem that I hadn’t thought about: I wasn’t measuring how much the blog was driving people to our site. Was my writing even worth my time? Was it worth the company’s time? That problem has since been rectified.</p>\\n<p>I wish I asked this question at my previous job more often. Asking why you are doing something can be the most valuable, hardest, and easiest thing you’ll ever do.</p>\",\"timeToRead\":9,\"excerpt\":\"Today is a great day for a blog post.

It’s hard to hear each other when you are each in your own B-52.</p>\\n<p>We learned the consequences of this the hard way, as I think many people, not just founders do too. A few weeks ago, it became clear that the pain points each of us thought Tangle would solve were different. I thought one thing, Cameron another, and Cole a hybrid. Our vision for the company was not in sync. How the in the world could that happen?</p>\\n<p>It took 14 hours of conversation to realign Tangle’s stars. We lost a full day. I remember in my two other jobs in finance and consulting similar, but less severe situations occurring.</p>\\n<p>“Wait, you aren’t working on updating the cap table?” I remember an associating asking me during my analyst days.</p>\\n<p>“No, was I meant to be?” Was not the right response.</p>\\n<p>So, how can you over-communicate, whether it be on the vision of a product, goal-setting or task management? Share early and share often. Information symmetry allows everyone to act optimally. The more optimally your colleagues can act, the better the work product, and (theoretically) the more money the company will make. That is good for everyone.</p>\\n<p>One thing we have done at Tangle to help this is move our goals, tasks, product documents, and user pain points out of the digital and onto whiteboards that are in plain site. Things get lost in shared drives. You forget to look at them, organize them, and update them. All of a sudden they are stale and your vision for what you are doing is blurry.</p>\\n<p>Keeping a written, explicit explanation of our goals for the week and month, our product vision and principles, and what problems the product solves in plain site keeps them permanently top-of-mind. It allows us to constantly be questioning what we are doing with the bigger picture in mind.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"read\\\"><a href=\\\"#read\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Read</h3>\\n<p>I never used to read. It was never a habit I formed outside of being forced to do it for school. What a shame.</p>\\n<p>One reason I never formed the habit was because reading seemed like work. Work that was always more scary than watching or listening to stuff. It is probably because reading is active. Watching and listening are passive. The marginal extra benefit of reading a book, though, far outweighs the marginal cost. I wish I understood those economics earlier.</p>\\n<p>Tangle has a book club, and that book club has helped me to form the healthy habit of reading. We read a book every two weeks or so and spend 30 minutes discussing it via a Slack call or in-person if we are all together. That exercise alone has brought me immense learning. It has made me more interesting and thoughtful at work. I have found myself often applying learnings from the books we read to my deliverables. It has also made me more interesting in my social life. It turns out that dating a guy that reads is “sexy.” Who knew.</p>\\n<p>Here is a smattering of the books I have read with the group and by myself:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TT1VLAO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&#x26;btkr=1\\\">Why Information Grows</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Brotopia-Breaking-Boys-Silicon-Valley-ebook/dp/B074LQKJJC/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&#x26;ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1529688319&#x26;sr=1-1&#x26;keywords=brotopia+breaking+up+the+boys%27+club+of+silicon+valley\\\">Brotopia</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078FZ9SYB/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&#x26;btkr=1\\\">Measure What Matters</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-30th-Anniversary-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B0090RVGW0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&#x26;ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1529688417&#x26;sr=1-1&#x26;keywords=on+writing+well\\\">On Writing Well</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup/dp/152473165X\\\">Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Start-up</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions-ebook/dp/B015CKNWJI/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&#x26;ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1529688541&#x26;sr=1-1&#x26;keywords=algorithms+to+live+by\\\">Algorithms to Live By</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People-ebook/dp/B003WEAI4E/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-text&#x26;ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1529689868&#x26;sr=1-3&#x26;keywords=how+to+win+friends+and+influence+people\\\">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3 id=\\\"write\\\"><a href=\\\"#write\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Write</h3>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That’s why it’s so hard.” - David McCullough</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>I do a lot of writing now. More than ever, actually. More than in high school and more than in college, where I wrote constantly for class assignments.</p>\\n<p>I always liked writing, but never knew how hard it was. I think this is because I never <em>actually</em> wrote well.</p>\\n<p>The better you can write about something, the better you understand something. The better I understand Tangle’s go-to-market strategy, our future customer’s pain points, the technology that Cameron and Cole are implementing to solve them, and even my own frustrations the better I can write about them. So I am practicing. Practicing everyday.</p>\\n<p>I am sure you are busy. I am sure there are many things ahead of writing in your personal stack ranking. My recommendation is to move “spend time writing,” up on that list. No matter what you do, writing about it will help clarify your thoughts.</p>\\n<p>I wish I wrote more about the problems I was tackling on behalf of my client during my consulting engagement. I was acting as a go-between evaluating a partnership with a company using blockchain technology to solve advertising fraud. Spending time writing coherently about what the heck a blockchain is might have helped my client better understand the opportunity and how to move forward.</p>\\n<p>The more you can write things down in a clear and concise manner, the more clearly you can think. I have found it is a lot like flexing a muscle. The more you do it, the stronger and more flexible that muscle will become. Try writing.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"make-the-most-of-lulls\\\"><a href=\\\"#make-the-most-of-lulls\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Make the most of lulls</h3>\\n<p>In every job there are lulls. Even a founder’s.</p>\\n<p>There are times that I am blocked. Cole taught me that word. You probably intuitively know what blocked means, but to be clear, it is when someone else is still working on something that needs to be complete for you to finish what you are working on. I currently can’t finish writing a guest post for a productivity blog because we haven’t finished a UI revamp and we want to insert some GIFs of the product. I am blocked.</p>\\n<p>You can make the most of lulls and blocks, however. I never used to think about this and wish I did. I bet at your job there are times during the day where you just aren’t doing much. How do you spend that time? Just think about the low hanging fruits you could pick when you are “chilling at work.” I bet there are a bunch and I bet they will taste sweet. I have no specifics to recommend here except to think about this the next time it happens.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"always-have-a-goal-in-mind-for-meetings\\\"><a href=\\\"#always-have-a-goal-in-mind-for-meetings\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Always have a goal in mind for meetings</h3>\\n<p>This lesson comes from a specific situation, but is so relevant. Cameron and I (Cole was in SF at the time) had a meeting with a partner at a venture capital firm. We had already met with him once before and this follow-up was meant to be somewhat of an update chat.</p>\\n<p>We didn’t go into the meeting with a clear goal, however, and when our 30 minutes was coming to an end, I found myself stuttering after he asked “So what can I be helpful with?”</p>\\n<p>Cameron saved the day by jumping in, but we both came away from the meeting knowing we had screwed up.</p>\\n<p>Have a goal in mind when you have a meeting, no matter how formal or informal. Meetings can be such a &#x26;*#@. They take you away from your work and are often more costly than helpful. The other party (or parties) will appreciate your clear intentions and your conversations will be much more effective too.</p>\\n<p>“Catching-up” just isn’t a useful reason to meet during a work day. Friends do that on Saturday afternoons in the park. It is a really easy thing to do, but I think a lot of people screw it up, including me.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"get-out-of-the-weeds\\\"><a href=\\\"#get-out-of-the-weeds\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Get out of the weeds</h3>\\n<p>This tidbit is an offshoot of the first five learnings but I think it deserves its own section.</p>\\n<p>It is incredibly difficult to think about something really hard, to research it, to write about it, and to constantly be talking about it without getting lost. Work is a process. There is a big difference, though, in simply being a part of the process, and understanding why you are part of the process and <em>why</em> that process is in place.</p>\\n<p>For example, this blog post is part of my process. I write one per week. The process began because we thought writing blog posts and sharing them would help attract a following of sorts. A marketing tool and a useful way to stay in touch with those that might be interested in what we are doing.</p>\\n<p>Recently though I got lost. Why I was writing was no longer clear. All I could see were trees, no forest. I recalibrated by asking Cameron and Cole why they thought I was writing the blog posts. It was a great exercise and helped me to regain my perspective. It also unveiled a problem that I hadn’t thought about: I wasn’t measuring how much the blog was driving people to our site. Was my writing even worth my time? Was it worth the company’s time? That problem has since been rectified.</p>\\n<p>I wish I asked this question at my previous job more often. Asking why you are doing something can be the most valuable, hardest, and easiest thing you’ll ever do.</p>\",\"timeToRead\":9,\"excerpt\":\"Today is a great day for a blog post.
