It’s called the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve. It makes you remember that forgetting happens for a reason.</p>\\n<p>Hermann Ebbinghaus began studying memory in the late 19th century hoping to apply the same mathematical rigor of the physical sciences to the mind. He began by memorizing random strings of nonsense syllables and would test himself on those lists from previous days. He was able to quantify what we all know intuitively: the number of items one can accurately recall goes down as time passes. It looks like this:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hex-blog-assets/curve.png\\\" alt=\\\"curve\\\"></p>\\n<p>His findings, however, left open many questions. Is this curve a good thing? And, why this curve in particular?</p>\\n<p>Not until about 30 years ago when a Carnegie Mellon professor named John Anderson was studying library retrieval systems did we have a breakthrough. His take on memory connected the principles of his two disciplines, computer science and psychology. He surmised that “the key to a good human memory becomes the same as the key to a good computer cache: predicting which items are most likely to be wanted in the future.¹”</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Your brain is good at predicting the future value of the data we ingest, and places it in your memory bank accordingly.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>He came up with the shelf metaphor already mentioned, and conceptualized a good memory organ would be one that keeps handy memories closer to the front of the shelf, and pushes the less valuable memories further back, in essence <em>forgetting them.</em></p>\\n<p>Anderson actually proved this by relating the curve to the real world. He and a colleague, Lael Schooler, performed Ebbinghaus-like studies not on human minds, but on society as a whole. His aim was to determine what patterns characterize the way the world itself “forgets” — the way that events and references fade over time. Anderson and Schooler looked at three human environments:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Headlines from the New York Times</li>\\n<li>Recordings of parents talking to their children</li>\\n<li>Anderson’s own email inbox</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>In all three domains, “a word was found to be more likely to appear again immediately after it had been used, and that the likelihood of seeing it again falls off as time goes on.” This finding is astounding. It showed that reality itself has a statistical structure that mimics the Ebbinghaus curve.</p>\\n<p>The way we forget things, then, is optimal. <strong>Your memory is tuned precisely to the frequency of your surroundings, organizing your memory so that we are able to remember what’s useful when we most likely need it.</strong></p>\\n<p>Take a step back and chew on this for a moment. What if you could remember every second of every day that you have ever lived? Those memories were always at the very front of your memory bank, easily experienced again and again. Would you want that power? Or would it be a burden?</p>\\n<p>There are people that have this ability, and it is far from ideal for them.</p>\\n<p>Amanda Price is one of those people. She is the first person to be diagnosed with what is now known as Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory, or HSAM, a condition she shares with around 60 known others. In a <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/feb/08/total-recall-the-people-who-never-forget\\\">New York Times article</a>, she describes how “she can remember most of the days of her life as clearly as the rest of us remember the recent past, with a mixture of broad strokes and sharp detail.”</p>\\n<p>HSAM makes traversing the metaphorical shelf too easy. Every bit of information is right at an afflicted person’s fingertips, just waiting to be surfaced.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><em>It is, she says, like living with a split screen: on the left side is the present, on the right is a constantly rolling reel of memories, each one sparked by the appearance of present-day stimuli. With so many memories always at the ready, Price says, it can be maddening: virtually anything she sees or hears can be a potential trigger.</em></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>This is paralyzing for Price. She lives in perpetual fear of any bad decision or hurtful experience because instead of learning and moving on from painful moments in her life, she continues to relive them.</p>\\n<p>An unfortunate superpower.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"learn-to-forget\\\"><a href=\\\"#learn-to-forget\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Learn to forget</h3>\\n<p>Forgetting keeps your memory from clutter, helps you to move on, and makes it easier to for your mind to function.
