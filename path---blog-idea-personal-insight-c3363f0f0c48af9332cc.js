Technology that allows a user to transform data into a digestible format is valuable. A massive spreadsheet of numbers suddenly becomes digestible, helping decision makers in companies more easily grasp historical trends and better predict the future of their businesses.</p>\n<p>Repackaging data into bar graphs, histograms, and bubble plots has become big business. According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/brandfeatures/venture-capital/article?id=5619">Reuters and Stratistics MRC</a>, the Global Business Intelligence (BI) market is expected to grow from $15.64 billion in 2016 to reach $29.48 billion by 2022. Companies clearly put a high value on understanding themselves, where they have been, what they have done, and where they are going. The BI market has exploded because they empower the enterprise to do that.</p>\n<p>But what about the individual? We the people are constantly creating data, leaving breadcrumbs that could be gobbled up and digested for the same purpose: to gain a better understanding of ourselves. Advertisers and marketers already do this for their own benefit with your <em>cookie crumbs</em> — segmenting internet users based on their behavior and serving ads against that data. But the personal breadcrumbs you leave should, and can, benefit you as well.</p>\n<p>The emails you send, tweets you tweet, and documents you create are all pieces of unstructured data that contextualize <em>you</em> over time. Repackaging your data into a digestible format would help <em>you</em> better understand <em>you</em>, just like how BI tools help business leaders.</p>\n<p>Can you remember what topics you were interested in, what events you were talking about, or what content you were creating five years ago? Last year? Last month? The evolution of your life, both professional and personal, is constant. Connecting your personal dots to concretize that evolution would be a useful tool on many levels.</p>\n<p>Turning your breadcrumbs into personal insights is something we have been thinking about recently. And we have come up with a couple ideas that we think could be useful personal insights (PI).</p>\n<h3 id="clustering"><a href="#clustering" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Clustering</h3>\n<p>Understanding how the concepts and topics in your content are related would be highly useful to anyone trying to zoom out and take a snapshot of themself today, or anytime in the past. The easiest way to take that meta-photo is to use clustering algorithms. Clustering algorithms allow us to help answer the question: what ideas, people, or concepts are the glue between the content you are creating? What is the main connector between those dots?</p>\n<p>Clustering divides data into groups such that those data points in the same group are more similar to other data points in that group than those in other groups. In simple words, the aim is to segregate groups with similar traits and assign them into clusters. Those clusters define the relationship between data points.</p>\n<p>In practice, you can imagine a visualization that segregates your network into clusters based on your interactions with those people via email or what notes you have written that are related to them. Seeing those clusters might help you more intuitively understand how the people in your network are connected, or how best to actually connect them in reality. You can see this concept below using Facebook data:</p>\n<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/usetangle-static-assets/blog/social-graph.png" alt="social-graph"></p>\n<h3 id="chronological-insights"><a href="#chronological-insights" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Chronological insights</h3>\n<p>Information management systems currently allow you to organize files in linear hierarchies. First, you organize files into folders normally based on some principle. You can then view those files alphabetically, oldest to newest newest-oldest, content format, and content size, just to name a few.</p>\n<p>The benefit of this structure is that you are able to organize things to your liking. They are also searchable and (most of the time) the document you are looking for will be returned to you. But structuring content this way does not give you much more than that.</p>\n<p>Instead, imagine you could plot your content -- your emails, tweets, documents, notes -- on an X and Y axis. The X axis is time and the Y axis is any measurable metric you would like. Take relevancy or saliency for example. You could drill down on the core concepts in your life, compare them, and learn how they change over time based on those principle metrics.</p>\n<p>Just like businesses reflect on backward looking data to make better forward-looking decisions, wouldn’t it be useful to have a personal dashboard to better understand yourself, what you have done, and how that is changing over time?</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id="a-personal-insight-engine"><a href="#a-personal-insight-engine" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>A personal insight engine</h3>\n<p><strong>Clustering</strong> and <strong>Chronological Insights</strong> are just two examples of real-time qualitative self-analytics (buzzwords!). Until recently, we haven’t had the tools to digest your personal breadcrumbs and turn them into a more holistic view of the self. I personally am compelled by the the idea of a personal dashboard. I have breadcrumbs scattered across data silos that might demystify the path I have taken to where I am now and clarify my experience and what I know; <strong>my knowledge.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Do you agree? I would love to hear your thoughts on the idea or for other ways to visualize your content in the name of self-analytics.
