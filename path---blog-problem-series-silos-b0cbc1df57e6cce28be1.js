When you open Evernote for example, the most recent file in which you you took notes is at the top of your notebook folder. Of course, you are able to search some of these tools, but from my experience, search features are only average or poor.</p>\n<h2 id="connecting-captures"><a href="#connecting-captures" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Connecting captures</h2>\n<p>The act of capturing thoughts is useful but connecting the dots between them is what allows for reflection, provides clarity, catalyzes ideation and helps people frame their thinking.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Connecting your thought-captures when you go back through your writings provides immense value.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This becomes very difficult when you write down notes in linear silos.</p>\n<p><strong>We are taking on the challenge of stopping thoughts from slipping through the cracks.</strong></p>',timeToRead:2,excerpt:"In our first  Problem Series  post, we used Cameron-types and Myles-types as foils to discuss the three core issues with the state of noteâ€¦",frontmatter:{title:"The Problem Series",cover:"",date:"2018-02-22",category:"Before Tangle",tags:["Notes","Problem","Silos","Apps"]},fields:{slug:"/blog-problem-series-silos"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/blog-problem-series-silos"}}}});
