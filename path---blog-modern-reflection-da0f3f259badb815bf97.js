Some days these are a stream of consciousness reflection on inspiration I’ve recently come across; other days a physical reservoir for project ideas that jump to mind.

In the ML paradigm, a computer is trained by being fed a set of documents with hand annotated rules, such as the part of speech of each word in a given sentence. The training data is analyzed and a model is generated that probabilistically infers the part of speech for a word in a sentence based on the word, the surrounding words, and the part of speech of the surrounding words. Just as we get better with practice, given enough training data, a computer will achieve high predictive accuracy at tagging new text. Moreover, this exercise can be extended to segment other features such as tense, named entities, topics, and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">sentiment</a>.</p>\n<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hex-blog-assets/syntax-1.png" alt="Sentence 1"></p>\n<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hex-blog-assets/syntax-2.png" alt="Sentance 2"></p>\n<p>So, when are you going to tie this back to morning pages?</p>\n<p>Perfect timing!</p>\n<p>In the simplest version, my morning pages can be aggregated into text form and indexed in time order. Once our clever computer friend labels the features we’ve trained it to classify, the fun begins!</p>\n<p>With the goal of synthesizing our parsed text into an output we can glean insights from, we can, for example, use statistical tools like clustering (surprise: more ML algorithms) to lump our thoughts into common themes. Recency and frequency can be included as factors to give more weight to the Jocko Willinck quote you couldn’t stop writing about yesterday relative to the Buddha quote that appears once a year ago.</p>\n<p>With the seemingly endless number of schemas, this is the stage at which innovation swoops in to deliver summarized content in an actionable, digestible format. Although my siloed morning pages may be a jambalaya of thoughts, an automated reflection process can transform them into an effortless tool I levy for ideation, introspection, and inspiration.</p>',timeToRead:3,excerpt:"Morning Pages The bedrock of my day is an exercise called  morning pages  – a free-flow cup of coffee with myself, where I put pen (or, in…",frontmatter:{title:"Reflection",cover:"",date:"2018-03-30",category:"Before Tangle",tags:["reflection","machine-learning"]},fields:{slug:"/blog-modern-reflection"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/blog-modern-reflection"}}}});
